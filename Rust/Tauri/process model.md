# **Process Model**
- `Tauri` employs a **multi-process architecture** similar to [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) or many modern web browsers
- during the early days of GUI apps, it was common to use a single process to perform computation, draw the interface and react to user input. A long-running, expensive computation would leave the user interface unresponsive, or worse, a failure in one app component would bring the whole app crashing down
- a more resilient architecture was needed, and applications began running different components in different processes, which makes much better use of modern multi-core CPUs and creates far safer applications. A crash in one component doesn't affect the whole system anymore, as components are isolated on different processes. If a process gets into an invalid state, we can easily restart it
- We can also limit the blast radius of potential exploits by handing out only the minimum amount of permissions to each process, just enough so they can get their job done. This pattern is known as the Principle of Least Privilege, and you see it in the real world all the time. If you have a gardener coming over to trim your hedge, you give them the key to your garden. You would not give them the keys to your house; why would they need access to that? The same concept applies to computer programs. The less access we give them, the less harm they can do if they get compromised
