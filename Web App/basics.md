## **1. Server-Side Rendering**
- server generates the response html document based on client's request, and send it back to the server
- Example: **Django**, **ASP.Net Core**, **Expres.js**
## **2. Client-Side Rendering**
- server generates only the data requried, and send it back to the client's browser, let client generate the response page instead
- server becomes gateway to the data, cna provide endpoints on the server where the client can talk to to get data
- push the responsibility to client, can serve more clients and request simultaneously, application become more scalable
- Example: **React.js**, **Angular.js**, **Vue.js**
