4. apt update: update the package database
5. ls: list all the files and folders in current working directory
6. pwd: print working directory
7. cd ~: go to the **HOME** dir
8. su {user}: switch to another user
9. mv test docker: rename the file name from test to docker OR to move files
10. rm filename: remove the file called "filename"
11. rm -r file/: remove all the files in the "file" folder recursively and finally remove the folder

## **Commands to deal with file**
1. nano docker: edit the file named "docker"
