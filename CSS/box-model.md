# **CSS Box Model**
- When laying out a document, the browser's rendering engine represents each element as a rectangular box
- CSS determines the size, position, and properties (color, background, border size, etc.) of these boxes
- every box is composed of 4 parts: **CONTENT, PADDING, BORDER, MARGIN**
