# **Centralized Exchange**
## **Basics**
- `centralized exchange (CEX)` refers to an online exchange platform where digital assets like Bitcoin(BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ether (ETH), and even tangible assets are traded
- `CEX` are controlled by a central authority, which is the biggest difference between `CEX` and `DEX`
- `CEX` acr as middleman between the buyers and sellers involved in trading, where the return is generated through transaction fees and commision
- `CEX` have their own rules and regulations, but they work on a common goal to provide users access to the prevalent assets
- **trading volume** is a curcial component for the success of a centralized exchange, higher trading volume brings less volatility which eliminates risks of market manipulation that are likely to occure on a particular exchange
- there centrally cleared and secure exchange have helped major companies to launch feature-packed exchanges where people can trade, invest, and earn returns with decent liquidity

## **How does CEX works?**

- `CEX` are fully governed and controlled by a central authority, and traders need to trust this centralized authoricty to perform further trades
- `CEX` works like a stock exchange, but it facilitates buying, selling, and exchanging digital assets instead of shares
- `CEX` requires traders to complete KYC (know your customer) verification to become registered users, the verification generally includes ID proof, name, address, and biometrics verification; once verified, the exchange ends login details to the users to log in to their account, go through the rules and start trading
- users on `CEX` cannot exchange assets directly, the exchange takes over the custody of funds that users deposit, and it then issues an equivalent amount of `IOUs (I owe you)` to the traders that they can exchange only at the time of withdrawal
- `IOUs` plays the role of **smart contracts** in centralized exchanges since it's an informal document acknowledgement representing the debt one party owes to another
- `CEX` adopt the **Order Book Method** to execute trades, which records the entire open orders to enable buying and selling of assets to traders. 
1. If a person wants to buy a particular asset, he must disclose the asset's astimated price to the middle man involved in the exchange process
2. Once the middleman finds someone whose request matches the buyer, it swaps the assets and compeltes the exchange between them
- **Order books** have disadvantages, such as `long waiting time` for the exchange to be done, and trader's inability to `corss-verify` the transaction

# **Decentralized Exchange**
## **Basics**
- `decentralized exchange (DEX)` is built on the blockchain that allows people to trade their digital assets on a secure and transparent platform without any intermediates
- `DEX` has essential features of `CEX`, and it stands out for facilitating the trade of all the coins available virtually, meaning traders do not need to be concerned about limited coin lisiting in `DEX`
- in `CEX`, 3rd parties look after the security and manage fund similar to banks and stock exchanges; `DEX` substitute the role of these 3rd parties with self-executing smart contracts to help simplify the exchange process
- allow for `peer-to-peer (P2P)` trading, which refers to a marketplace that links buyer and sellers of cryptocurrencies, and are usually non-custodial, which means user keep control of their wallet's private keys

## **How DEX works?**
- `DEX` have evolved through multiple iterations, with 1st gen `DEX` using **Order Books**, and latest `DEX` implementing a new mechanism called **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**
