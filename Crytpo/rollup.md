## Rollup ##
- a scaling solution that groups transactions together and process them off-chain before sending them back to main blockchain
- designed to increase the number of transactions of a blockchain can handle without increasing gas fees

## ZK-SNARK Rollup ##
- a type of zero-knowledge rollup that uses a cryptographic proof called a zk-snark to verify transactions on a blockchain
- use cryptographic proofs to assume transactions are false until proven valid

## Optimistic Rollup ##
- Use fraud proof to assume transactions are valid unless proven otherwise
