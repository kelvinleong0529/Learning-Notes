# **Margin Trading**
- `margin trading` in crypto allows user to trade crypto with more money than they actually have
- in exchange for some extra fees and interest, traders can try to amplify their gains (or lesses) using borrowed money
- has the potential to lead to unbelievable gains - or devastating losses
- involves borrowing funds from an exchange and using it to make a trade, also referred to as `trading with leverage` because it involves traders **leveraging up** their trades beyond the existing capital they have to work with

# **How Does Margin Trading works?**
- `margin trading` involves borrowing money in order to make larger or more trades, but an important factor to keep in mind is what's called the `liquidation price`. When the market reaches the `liquidation price`, the exchange will automatically **close** a postion, so that traders only lose their own money and not the funds that were lent out to them
- when one is trading with their own funds, the `liquidation price` for a long position on an asset is **zero**, but with increasing leverage, the `liquidation price` climbs closer to price at which a trader buys

## **Liquidation Price Calculation**
- to calculate the size of a market move that will trigger a liquidation, simply divide 100 by the level of leverage
- eg: a position with 10x leverage requires only a 10% move to be liquidated (100/10=10)

## **Fees for Crypto Margin Trading**
1. Fees for opening a position
2. Interest owed for borrowing coins
- the `interest rate`, known as the `funding rate`, is peer-to-peer and depends on a variety of factors like the current premium between the spot and futures prices of an asset
- the `interest rate` is usually re-calculated each hour
