# **Moving Average Convergence Divergence**
## **3 common MACD trading strategies**
## **1. Crossovers**
- a `buy` signal comes when the shorter-term, more reactive line - the `MACD` line crosses above the slower line - the `signal` line
- conversely, when `MACD` line crosses below `singal` line it provides a bearish `sell` signal
- crossover strategy is lagging by nature, it is based on waiting for a movement to occur before opening a position
- main issue faced by `MACD` in weaker market trends, is that by the time a signal is generated, the price maybe be reaching a reversal point, would then be considered a `false signal`

## **2. Histogram Reversals**
- when the market is `moving strongly` in a direction, the histogram will increase in height, and when the histogram shrinks, it is a sign that the market is `moving slower`

## **3. Zero Crosses**
- this strategy is based on either of the `EMAs` crossing the zero line
- if `MACD` crosses the zero line from below, a new uptrend may be emerging, while the `MACD` crossing from above is a signal that a new downtrend may be starting
- `BUY` or `CLOSE SHORT POSITION` when `MACD` crosses above the zero line
- `SELL` or `CLOSE LONG POSITION` when `MACD` crosses below the zero line
