### No Ownership Rights
- When you own an option, you have the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset (e.g., a stock) at a specified price within a certain time frame. However, until you actually exercise the option and purchase the underlying shares, you do not own the stock.
### No Voting Rights:
- Because you do not own the stock itself, you do not have any voting rights. This means you cannot participate in shareholder meetings, vote on corporate matters, or have any influence over decisions like electing the board of directors or approving company policies.
### No Dividend Entitlement:
- As an option holder, you are not entitled to receive dividends. Dividends are paid to shareholders who own the underlying stock, not to those who hold options on the stock.

5. options gives us the potential to benefit from changes in the price of the underlying security, but it does not provide the rights and privileges of actual ownership, such as voting in board meetings and receiving dividends
