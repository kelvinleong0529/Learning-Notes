# **Bridging**
- `Cross-Chain Interoperability` allows a token to exist on more than 1 blockchain, it allows for the transfer of tokens between different blockchain networks
- There are different methods for achieving cross-chain interoperability, but one popular approach is through the use of a `bridge`
- `bridge` is a software or network infrastructure that allows for the transfer of tokens between different blockchains; it can be implemented in many different ways, byt they generally involve locking tokens on one blockchain and issuing a corresponsing amount of tokens on another blockchain
- For example, let's say that there is a token called "ABC" that exists on the Ethereum blockchain, and a user wants to transfer it to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). They could use a bridge that allows for the locking of the ABC token on the Ethereum blockchain, and the issuance of a corresponding amount of ABC tokens on the Binance Smart Chain. This would enable the user to transfer the ABC token from one blockchain to another, while maintaining its value and functionality.

# **Vesting**
- `vesting` involves setting aside some of a coin's total supply and releasing them into the market after certain conditions have been met
- the period in which the tokens are locked up is known as the vesting period or token lock up, and investors cannot transact or trade those specific tokens during this time.

# **Ciruclating Supply**
- `circulating supply` defines how many units of that cryptocurrency are swirling around the market at any one time
- this does not refer to all the units of that cryptocurrency that we can buy on a crypto exchange, just the cryptocurrency that's out there on the blockchain today and can be freely sent between wallets

# **Total Supply**
- `total supply` is the total number of tokens that exist on the blockchain, including tokens that aren't in public circulation
- when a cryptocurrency project launches a new token or coin, they might create lots more crypto that they distribute at that moment
- For instance, coins earmarked for `staking rewards` – those given to people who lock up tokens within a protocol – might technically “exist” on the blockchain, but you might not be able to start earning them until a certain condition has been met or date has been passed

# **Maximum Supply**
- `maximum supply` of a token refers to the total number of coins that can ever be minted
- for instance, max supply for Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, once the number of coins in circulation reaches 21 million, no more coins can be mined - generated as a reward for discovering new Bitcoin blocks

# **Diluted Market Cap**
- a multiplication of a token's maximum supply by its current price, including vested tokens
- can provide hints that some market actors, like early investors or the project's team, could sell a whole lot of tokens on the open market once they have access to the coin

# **Token Burning**
- the process by which a crypto coin project burns a certain mount of its crypto coin digitial assets
- involves transferring some amount of cryptocurrency into a burn wallet address (also known as `burn wallet`) with no private key
- coin burning means once coins have been sent to a burn address, they become permenantly excluded from the overall circulating supply of coins in the crypto market, and is forever inaccessible for exchange or other transactions
- similar to a company buying a large number of its shares, but its different because coins burnt cannot be resold
- by burning cryptocurrency, a project can reduce the total supply of its token in circulation and gradually increase its value over time, as market function through demand and supply, token burning reduce supply and increase demand, and potentially add value to their crypto
- Cons of token burning:
1. Some companies seek a considerable gain from the devaluation of a token. These companies wait for moments when a token experiences a dip, and they buy a considerable amount of that token, only to sell it all after a little pump. Companies that partake in this are called hidden whales, and they can lead to a token burn backfiring against a token project.
2. Some projects may pretend to strengthen their network by transferring vast amounts of their tokens to a wallet. Although these projects claim to send their community token to a burn wallet address, they send it to a wallet address where they can retrieve it. Some projects crash their tokens by doing this, which can be tragic for community members.
