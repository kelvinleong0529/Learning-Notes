# **Blockspace**
- `blockspace` is the driving force behind all blockchain networks, it is a computing and sotrage unit that exists on blockchains and is independent of hardware owners
- it is a blochain storage space that can be used to store data and run code
- when a user initiates a transaction, it's peer-to-peer, and the will be charged a fee, this fee indicates a desire to buy a blockspace, allowing the transaction to be processed and included in a block
- due to limited block size, only a limited number of transactions can be processed at any given time, which gives blockspace an implicit time value
- users' fee refelct their willingness to bid for its spacetime

# **Congestions and Fees**
- ETH holders are familiar with scaling problem, which is a contentious issue, and quite a number of blockchains believe the best way to expand blockspace is through `Layer 2`
- if properly designed, L2s inherit the security properties of the lower layer, so we can still have the strong security guarantees of ETH, but at the same time they provide addition blockspace capacity on top where apps can run with lower gas fees
- L2s are ony way to increase supply, while another is through system design; Solana for example, is attempting to achieve complete scaling on L1
- another way blockspace will expand is with more L1 blockchains
