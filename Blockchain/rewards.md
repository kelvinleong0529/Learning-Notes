# **Staking**
- `staking` is the process of holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet or exchange account, and then using that balance to support the network
- it involves holding a cryptocurrency asset in a designated wallet for a specified period to earn rewards in the form of more of the same cryptocurrency or other assets
- some cryptocurrencies use a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which requires validators to stake a certain amount of the cryptocurrency in order to participate in the network and validate transactions
- some cryptocurrencies use a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) mechanism, which allows users to vote for delegates who will validate transactions on their behalf

# **Yield Farming**
- a method of earning interest on your cryptocurrency holdings by lending them out or staking them in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, these protocols offer various incentives, such as governance tokens, to incentivize users to lock up their assets and provide liquidity to the platform
1. an investor would first need to acquire a cryptocurrency asset that is compatible with DeFi protocols, such as Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain
2. once they have acquired the asset, they would then need to deposit it into a DeFi protocol, such as a liquidity pool
3. When a user deposits assets into a liquidity pool, they receive liquidity pool tokens in return
4. After depositing their assets into a liquidity pool, yield farmers can then start earning additional cryptocurrency by providing liquidity to the pool
5. This is done by using their liquidity pool tokens to participate in various DeFi activities, such as lending, borrowing, or trading
6. For example, a yield farmer might provide liquidity to a lending platform by lending their cryptocurrency assets to borrowers in exchange for interest payments
7. Alternatively, they might use their liquidity pool tokens to participate in a liquidity mining program, where they can earn rewards for providing liquidity to a particular DeFi protocol
- Yield farmers earn additional cryptocurrency by receiving a portion of the fees generated by the DeFi protocol they are participating in
- These fees are typically paid in the form of the cryptocurrency asset they are farming

# **Liquidity Mining**
- is a subset of `yield farming`, primary difference is that liquidity providers are compensated with the platform’s own coin in addition to fee revenue
-  is a process that incentivizes users to provide liquidity to a DEX by offering rewards in the form of tokens, is a way for users to earn passive income by contributing to the liquidity pool of a DEX
1. Suppose there is a DeFi protocol that allows users to trade between two tokens, Token A and Token B. 
2. To enable trading, the protocol requires liquidity in the form of both tokens. LPs can provide liquidity by depositing equal amounts of Token A and Token B into the liquidity pool
3. Now let’s say that a user wants to swap 100 Token A for Token B. The protocol will execute the trade using the liquidity in the pool provided by the LPs. 
4. If there is not enough liquidity for the trade, the protocol will automatically adjust the prices to attract more LPs to provide liquidity.
5. LPs earn rewards in the form of the protocol’s native tokens, such as UNI, COMP, or SUSHI, depending on the protocol. 
6. The tokens are distributed to LPs in proportion to their contribution to the liquidity pool. For example, if an LP contributes 10% of the total liquidity pool, they will receive 10% of the rewards.
