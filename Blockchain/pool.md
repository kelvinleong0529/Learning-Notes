# **Liquidity Pool**
- cryptocurrency market is an active community that initiates thousands of transactions to be verified daily, but verifying these transactions can be pretty slow
- `liquidity pools` provide a faster means of turning digital assets into cash, and this optiosn can be helpful for people who make frequent transactions
- `liquidity pool` is a smart contract containing large portions of cryptocurrency, digital assets, tokens, or virtual coins locked up and ready to provide essential liquidity for networks that facilitate decentralized trading
- `DEX` relies greatly on liquidity because of the regular rate at which transactions are made on their network; for this reason, decentralized exchanges need to be connected to liquidity pools that can help maintain a steady functional network that doesn’t delay transactions made by traders
- digital assets are locked and ready for exchange, liquidity pools serve as a digital asset reserve that can provide liquidity to help speed up transactions for decentralized finance markets such as decentralized exchanges

# **How do liquidity pool works?**
- Unlike traditional finance, which pairs buyers and sellers to complete a transaction, liquidity pools do not need to connect users to complete a trade; instead, they function automatically through automated market makers (amms) that connect us to the smart contract with our requested digital assets locked up in them
- AMMs are the protocols used to determine the price of digital assets, and it does a great job of providing the most reasonably accurate market price on liquidity pools
- users can adapt the steps below to any liquidity pool platform:
1. Credit your crypto wallet with the crypto tokens you aim to lock up in a liquidity pool and connect it to the liquidity pool platform of your choosing or sign up on a liquidity pool platform and credit the liquidity pool wallet of your account on that platform’s wallet
2. Find the trading pairs you’d like to invest in and deposit an equally divided portion of your crypto investment into that trading pair; for example, to invest $1000 into an ETH and USDT trading pair, you would need to deposit $500 each in both ETH and USDT on that liquidity pool
- Once users made their deposit, they have to select the period they want to have it locked up in the pool
- After the period of lockup has elapsed, liquidity provider will be rewarded with liquidity pool tokens according to their selected trading pair and liquidity pool platform
- during the lockup period, liquidity providers will also acquire an earning portion of the transaction fees paid to make exchanges with the pool they committed their crypto

# **Why is liquidity pool important?**
- Liquidity pools play a significant role in providing liquidity in illiquid markets and boosting the DeFi ecosystem
- The low liquidity that peer-to-peer exchanges offer can slow down the speed of transactions in financial markets
- with the help of liquidity pools where tokens are locked up in smart contracts, people can make transactions quickly
- the price of assets on crypto liquidity pools is also very fair as they can only be influenced by the current market exchange rate, which offers relatively accurate prices for the assets they supply to liquidity pool intelligent contracts
- Unlike traditional exchanges, where buyers and sellers can influence the bidding price of their transactions with other traders, liquidity pools provide a more consistent environment where prices can be more accurate
