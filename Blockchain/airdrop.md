# **Airdrop**
- `cryptocurrency airdrop` is a marketing strategy that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet address
- small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency
- ultimate goal is to promote awareness and circulation of a new token or coin
- while some are legitimate, other airdrops have been seen as fraudulent when attempting to steal wallet or personal information
- airdrops may be based on those who express interest, hold existing tokens, are intentionally selectedm or win raffles

# **Type of airdrops**
## **1. Standard Airdrop**
- participants simply express their interest in order to receive the airdrop
- individual must provide a valid wallet address, and some airdrops require no additional information beyond this
- often have a set amount of tokens to distribute with a limit on how many tokens each individual may receive
- some `standard airdop` are time-sensitive
- though these types of airdrops are popular due to their simplicity, there is nothing stopping a single user from creating multiple wallets to quickly drain the airdrop amount, so these may be more difficult to obtain

## **2. Bounty Airdrop**
- occur when users perform certain tasks, where these tasks often entail raising awareness of a project by posting on social media and tagging the company or retweeting a recent tweet about the project
- there may be referral bonuses or finder fees for individuals who recruit other users, sign up for the project's newsletter, or join the company's Discord channel
- in exchange for performing tasks, users often receive points that correspond to how large of bounty airdop they receive
- user may also be required to earn a certain amount of points before they are qualified for the airdop, eg: a user may be eligible for an airdrop after earning 300 points with each item mentioned above is worth 100 points each

## **3. Holder Airdrop**
- occur automatically based on who is holding existing tokens and how many token they hold
- since wallets and blockchains information are part of a publicly distributed ledger, all users of blockchain have full transparency into the wallets and distributions of tokens
- ensure that only the largest, most invested individual receive the benefit
- some holder airdrops may only award an airdrop if members are holding a certain amount of tokens, otherwise they may pro-rate the award amount

## **4. Exclusive Airdrop**
- occurs when specific people are individually selected for the airdop
- difference is that they may be selected not based on the amount of tokens they have but based on other elements such as `time spent on a project`, `most money spent on non-token activity`, or `number of posts in a forum`
- is a more centralized way of rewarding those closest to the project and may give airdrops to wallets that may not hold any tokens at all

## **5. Raffle Airdrop**
- some of the airdrops above may be combined with a `raffle airdrop`
- sometimes, a project will state the number of airdrops they intend to give and encourage individuals to earn a raffle ticket
- this raffle ticket may be earned by holding tokens, earning points, or simply expressing interest
- Ultimately, the number of individuals interested in the airdrop often exceeds the number of airdrops the company wishes to deliver
- Therefore, a raffle occurs and a limited number of wallets are randomly selected to receive the airdrop
