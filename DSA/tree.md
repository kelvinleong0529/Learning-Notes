# **B-Tree**
- `B-Tree` is known as a self-balancing tree
- a node can have more than 2 children
- `B-Tree` has a height on `logM N`, where (M is the order of the tree and N is the number of the nodes)
- height is adjusted automatically at each update
- data is sorted in a specific order, with the lowest value on the left and highest value on the right
- inserting data or key in B-tree is more complicated than a binary tree
