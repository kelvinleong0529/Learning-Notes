# **Advanced Encryption Standard**
- `Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)` is a **symmetric** encryption that uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data
- It uses `Substitution Permutation Network (SPN)` algorithm, applying multiple rounds to encrypt data
- there are different length of AES encryption keys, but usually longer keys (with more bits) might have higher power consumption

# **Advantages of AES**
1. encryption process is relatively easier to understand, allows for easy implementation, as well as really fast encryption and decryption times
2. requires less memory that many other types of encryption
3. if an action requires an extra layer of safety, we can combine AES with various security protocols like `WPA2` or even other types of encryption like `SSL`

# **Example of AES usage**
1. VPNs
2. Wi-F
3. Mobile Application
4. Archive and Compression Tools
5. OS system components
6. Programming Language Libraries
7. Password Managers
