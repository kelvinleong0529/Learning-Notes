# **Application Signing**
## **Desktop Apps**
- digitally signing executable files help us to protect our application's integrity and establish trust, as one of the most common ways people receive malware is through exectubale files

## **Mobile Apps**
- allows developer to identify the author of the application and to update their application without creating complicated interfaces and permissions
- every application running on `Android` platform must be signed by the developer, application that attempt to install without being signed will be rejected by either `Google Play` or the package installer on Android device
