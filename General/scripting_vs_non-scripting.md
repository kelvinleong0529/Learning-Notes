# **Scripting Language**
- a series of commands that are able to be executed without the need for compiling
- All scripting languages are programming languages, but not all programming languages are scripting languages
- Scripting languages use a program known as an interpreter to translate commands and are directly interpreted from source code, not requiring a compilation step
- Programming languages, on the other hand, may require a compiler to translate commands into machine code before it can execute those commands
- In compiled programming languages, a compiler program translates code written in a high level programming language into a lower-level language in order for the program to execute. C or Java programs must usually be compiled first in order to run. Two well-known compilers are Eclipse for Java and gcc for C and C++. The easiest way to understand how a compiler functions is to think about various operating systems. For instance, Windows programs are compiled to run on Windows platforms and thus are not compatible with Mac

# **Server-Side Scripting VS Client-Side Scripting**
- Server-Side Scripting languages requires server for processing, while Client-Side Scripting Languages run on the client end (on their web browser)
- Client-side scripts can reduce demand on the server, allowing web pages to load faster
- Server-side scripts are not viewable by the public like client-side scripts are
- Client-side scripting is more focused on user interface and functionality, and server-side scripting focuses on faster processing, access to data, and resolving errors
- Client-Side Scripting Languages: CSS, HTML, JavaScript
- Sever-Side Scripting Languages: PHP, ASP.NET, Java, Ruby, Perl, Python
