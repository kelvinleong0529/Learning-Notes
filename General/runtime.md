# **Runtime Environment**
- `runtime environment` is the environment in which a program or application is executed
- its the hardware and software infrastructure that supports the running of a particular codebase in real time
- `runtime environment` is extremely important in figuring out how to use a piece of software, resources have to be allocated correctly in order for a `runtime environment` to be successful
- right relationships have to be set up to allow program and multithread processing, and the program has to be able to correctly access the assets it needs to run
- with **virtualization**, a runtime environment can be a virtual machine instead of a physical machine, resources can be allocated relatively on-the-fly

# **Runtime Error**
- `runtime error` is related to invalid instruction, happened because of deficiencies in the runtime environment - maybe the program doesnt have the right access to a library or reference or other resources that i needs, and this result is a "crash" in the form a runtime error
