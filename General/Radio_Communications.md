# **Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)**
- a form of wireless communication that use electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in radio frequency portion of EM spectrum to uniquely identify something
- consists of 3 components: **Antenna, Transceiver, Transponder**
- antenna + transceiver = RFID readers, uses radio waves to transmit signal to activate the tag, then the tag is activated, the tag sends back a wave back to the antenna, wehre it is translated into data
- **TRANSCEIVER** => can both transmit and receive waves using antenna
- **TRANSPONDER** => a radio or radar that upon receiving signal emits a radio signal of its own
- **Active RFID**: an active RFID tag that has its own power source, usually a battery
- **Passive RFID**: a RFID tag that receives power from the reading antenna, who EM wave induces a current in the RFID tag's antenna

| **RFID tags**                                                                                                      | **Barcodes**                                                        |

| Can   identify individual objects without direct line of sight.                                                | Direct   line of sight required for scanning                    |
| Can   scan items from inches to feet away, depending on type of tag and reader.                                | Require   closer proximity for scanning.                        |
| Data   can be updated in real time.                                                                            | Data   is read-only and can't be changed.                       |
| Require   a power source.                                                                                      | No   power source needed.                                       |
| Read   time is less than 100 milliseconds per tag.                                                             | Read   time is half a second or more per tag.                   |
| Contain   a sensor attached to an antenna, often contained in a plastic cover and more   costly than barcodes. | Printed   on the outside of an object and more subject to wear. |

# **Near-field Communication (NFC)**
- transmit data through EM radio fields to enable 2 devices to communicate with each other
- both devices must contain NFC chips, transactions take palce within a very short distance
- action must be performed intentionally, cant purchase something unknowingly because of a pocket-dial or by walking past a location that's embedded with an NFC chip

# **E-passport**
- Electronic passport has a contactless microprocessor that stores the digital version of the ID photo and all the ID data found on the first page of passport
- can also store digital fingerprint
