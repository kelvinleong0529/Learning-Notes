# **GRID trading**
- `grid trading` involves setting multiple predetermined price levels to which buy or sell orders are automatically executed when the price touches such levels
- idea behind is that if the price moves in a sustained direction the position gets bigger to capitailize on it, as the price moves up, more buy orders are triggered resulting in a bigger position, the position gets bigger and more profitable the further the price runs in that direction
- this will lead to dilemma, ultimately the trader must determine when to end the grid, and realize the profits, otherwise, the price could reverse and those profits will disappear

# **Example of how GRID trading works**
# **1. Sideway Markets**

1. to setup the grid, the trader first needs to decide on a reference price; in the above example of a sideway market, buy orders should be set below the reference price
2. Each buy order has a corresponding sell order set at levels (in this case, 2 levels) above the buy orders
3. the distance between each price level (gridlines) is typically set to be the same
4. traders also need to sets a maximum price level that no sell orders will be executed above, and a minimum price level that no buy orders will be executed below

# **2. Uptrending Markets**

1. in the above example of an uptrending market, buy orders are set above the reference point
2. each buy order has a corresponding sell order set at levels (in this case, 1 level) above the buy orders
3. the trader also sets a maximum price level that no buy orders will be executed at or above

# **3. Downtrending Markets**

1. in the above example of a downtrending market, short-sell orders are set below the reference price
2. each short-sell order has a corresponding order to close the short-sell position set at levels (in this case, 1-level) below the short-sell orders
3. the trader also sets a minimum price that no short-sell orders will be executed at or below
