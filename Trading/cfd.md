## CFD (contract for difference) ##
- a financial derivative that allow traders to speculate on the price movement of underlying asset **without actually owning the asset**
- Key Characteristics of CFDs:
1. Speculation on Price Movement:
- Traders can profit from both rising (going long) and falling (going short) prices.
2. No Ownership of the Underlying Asset:
- You don’t own the actual stock, commodity, or currency; you’re merely speculating on its price change.
3. Leverage:
- CFDs are traded on margin, meaning you only need to deposit a fraction of the trade's total value to open a position. This amplifies both potential gains and losses.
4. Wide Range of Markets:
- CFDs can be traded on stocks, indices, commodities, forex, cryptocurrencies, and more.
5. Fees:
   - Spread: The difference between the bid and ask price.
   - Overnight Fees: Charged for holding positions overnight.
   - Commission (sometimes): Charged for entering/exiting trades (common for stock CFDs).
