## Overnight Fees ##
- also known as **swap fee** or **rollover fee**, is a cost charged by a broker to keep a leveraged position open overnight
- common in **margin trading** and **CFDs (contract for difference)**
1. Why it's charged?
- When you trade on margin, the broker essentially lends you money to maintain a larger position. The overnight fee compensates the broker for the cost of carrying this position, similar to an interest charge.
2. How it's calculated?
- The fee is typically based on the size of the position, the leverage used, and the interest rate differential (for forex) or a standard rate set by the broker.
- It can be positive (you earn interest) or negative (you pay interest), depending on the position and the instrument being traded.
3. When It’s Applied?
- Overnight fees are usually charged for positions held open past a specific time, often referred to as the broker’s cutoff time (e.g., 10:00 PM GMT).
