# **Simple Moving Average**
- `simple moving average (SMA)` is popular with traders and market analysts because historcial analysis of price movements shows it to be an effective trend indicator
- is a trednline that represents the daily plotting of closing prices for a stock, averaged over a certain period (50-days, 100-days, 200-days etc)
- depending on a stock's current price action and where it appears relative to the 50-day SMA, this trendline can indicate a stock's strength or weakness
- it's called `simple` because it weights each day's closing price the same, this contrasts with `exponential moving average (EMA)`, which weights recent closing price more heavily
- is considered the first line of support in an uptrend or the first line of resistance in a downtrend
