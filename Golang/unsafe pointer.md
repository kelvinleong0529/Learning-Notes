# **Unsafe Pointer**
- there are many restrictions from `Go` pointers, they cant participate in arithmetic operations, and for 2 arbitrary pointer types, their values cant be converted to each other
- `unsafe pointer` are powerful, and also dangerous
- `safe pointer` can be explicitly converted to an unsafe pointer, and vice versa
