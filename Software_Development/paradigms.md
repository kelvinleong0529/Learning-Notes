# **What is a paradigm?**
- `paradigm` is a set of assumptions, concepts, values, and practices that constitutes a way of viewing reality for the community that shares them, especially in an intellectual discipline

# **Procedural Programming**
- `procedural code` is the code that directly instructs a device on how to finish a task in logical steps
- uses a linear top-down approach and treats data and procedures as 2 different entities
- based on the concept of procedure call, Procedural Programming divides the program into procedures, which are also known as routines or functions, simply containing a series of steps to be carried out
- simply put, `procedural programming` involves writing down a list of instructions to tell the computer what is should do step-by-step to finish the task at hand

# **Object-Oriented Programming**
- an approach to programmng which recognizes life as we know it as a collection of objects, which work in tandem with each other to solve a particular problem at hand
- primary thing to know about OOP is `encapsulation`, which is the idea that each object which holds the program is self-sustainable, which means that all the components that make up the object are within the object itself
- since each module in OOP is self-sustainable, objects can be taken from one program and used to resolve another problem at hand with little or no alterations

# **Functional Programming**
- `functional programming` means using functions to the best effect for creating clean and maintainable software
- ideal in `functional programming` is what `pure functions`, which are the ones whose results are dependent only upon the input parameters, and whose operation initiates no side effect, meaning it makes no external impact besides the return value
- this is in contrast to OOP where object methods are designed to interact with the state of the object (the object members) and in contrast to procedural programming where external state is often manipulated from within the function
